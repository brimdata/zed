# ============================================================================
# NOTE: This is a test to protect an example shown in the SuperPipe language
# docs. If you need to make changes to the SuperPipe below to make the tests pass
# again after a change, the docs likely need to be updated as well.
#
# See https://github.com/brimdata/super/pull/2901 for details
# ============================================================================

# The SuperPipe being tested below has been modified from the way it appears in
# docs/language/README.md:
#
#   from (
#     pool PoolOne => op1 | op2 | ...
#     pool PoolTwo => op1 | op2 | ...
#   ) | join on key=key | ...
#
# Specifically, the "op1", "op2", and "..." have been filled in with real
# operations, and a field assignment has been added to the join
# (https://github.com/brimdata/super/issues/2815).
