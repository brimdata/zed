# Data Types

Comprehensive documentation for working with data types in Zed is still a work
in progress. In the meantime, here's a few tips to get started with.

* Values are stored internally and treated in expressions using one of the Zed
  data types described in the
  [Primitive Values](../formats/zson.md#33-primitive-values) section of the
  ZSON spec.
* See the [Equivalent Types](../../zeek/Data-Type-Compatibility.md#equivalent-types)
  table for details on which Zed data types correspond to the
  [data types](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/types.html)
  that appear in Zeek logs.
* Zed allows for [type casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion)
  by specifying a destination Zed data type followed by the value to be
  converted to that type, enclosed in parentheses.

#### Example:

In the Zeek `ntp` log, the field `ref_id` is of Zeek's `string` type, but is
often populated with a value that happens to be an IP address. When treated as
a string, the attempted CIDR match in the following Zed would be unsuccessful
and no records would be counted.

```
zq -f table 'ref_id in 83.162.0.0/16 | count()' ntp.log.gz
```

However, if we cast it to an `ip` type, now the CIDR match is successful. The
`bad cast` warning on stderr tells us that some of the values for `ref_id`
could _not_ be successfully cast to `ip`.

```mdtest-command dir=zed-sample-data/zeek-default
zq -f table 'put ref_id:=ip(ref_id)| filter ref_id in 83.162.0.0/16 | count()' ntp.log.gz
```

#### Output:
```mdtest-output
bad cast
count
28
```
