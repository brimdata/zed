# Expressions

Zed expressions follow the typical patterns in programming languages.
Expressions are typically used within data flow operators
to perform computations on input values and are typically evaluated once per each
input value [`this`](dataflow-model.md#the-special-value-this).

For example, `yield`, `where`, `cut`, `put`, `sort` and so forth all take
various expressions as part of their operation.

## Arithmetic

Arithmetic operations (`*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`) follow customary syntax
and semantics and are left-associative with multiplication and division having
precedence over addition and subtraction.  `%` is the modulo operator.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield 2*3+1, 11%5, 1/0, "foo"+"bar"'
```
produces
```mdtest-output
7
1
error("divide by zero")
"foobar"
```

## Comparisons

Comparison operations (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`) follow customary syntax
and semantics and result in a truth value of type `bool` or an error.
A comparison expression is any valid Zed expression compared to any other
valid Zed expression using a comparison operator.

When the operands are coercible to like types, the result is the truth value
of the comparison.  Otherwise, the result is `false`.

If either operand to a comparison
is `error("missing")`, then the result is `error("missing")`.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield 1 > 2, 1 < 2, "b" > "a", 1 > "a", 1 > x'

```
produces
```mdtest-output
false
true
true
false
error("missing")
```

## Containment

The `in` operator has the form
```
<item-expr> in <container-expr>
```
and is true if the `<item-expr>` expression results in a value that
appears somewhere in the `<container-expr>` as an exact match of the item.
The right-hand side value can be any Zed value and complex values are
recursively traversed to determine if the item is present anywhere within them.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '{a:[1,2]}{b:{c:3}}{d:{e:1}}' | zq -z '1 in this' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{a:[1,2]}
{d:{e:1}}
```
You can also use this operator with a static array:
```mdtest-command
echo '{accounts:[{id:1},{id:2},{id:3}]}' | zq -z 'over accounts | where id in [1,2]' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{id:1}
{id:2}
```

## Logic

The keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` perform logic on operands of type `bool`.
The binary operators `and` and `or` operate on Boolean values and result in
an error value if either operand is not a Boolean.  Likewise, `not` operates
on its unary operand and results in an error if its operand is not type `bool`.
Unlike many other languages, non-Boolean values are not automatically converted to
Boolean type using "truthiness" heuristics.

## Field Dereference

Record fields are dereferenced with the dot operator `.` as is customary
in other languages and have the form
```
<value> . <id>
```
where `<id>` is an identifier representing the field name referenced.
If a field name is not representable as an identifier, then [indexing](#indexing)
may be used with a quoted string to represent any valid field name.
Such field names can be accessed using
[`this`](dataflow-model.md#the-special-value-this) and an array-style reference, e.g.,
`this["field with spaces"]`.

If the dot operator is applied to a value that is not a record
or if the record does not have the given field, then the result is
`error("missing")`.

## Indexing

The index operation can be applied to various data types and has the form:
```
<value> [ <index> ]
```
If the `<value>` expression is a record, then the `<index>` operand
must be coercible to a string and the result is the record's field
of that name.

If the `<value>` expression is an array, then the `<index>` operand
must be coercible to an integer and the result is the
value in the array of that index.

If the `<value>` expression is a set, then the `<index>` operand
must be coercible to an integer and the result is the
value in the set of that index ordered by total order of Zed values.

If the `<value>` expression is a map, then the `<index>` operand
is presumed to be a key and the corresponding value for that key is
the result of the operation.  If no such key exists in the map, then
the result is `error("missing")`.

If the `<value>` expression is a string, then the `<index>` operand
must be coercible to an integer and the result is an integer representing
the unicode code point at that offset in the string.

If the `<value>` expression is type `bytes`, then the `<index>` operand
must be coercible to an integer and the result is an unsigned 8-bit integer
representing the byte value at that offset in the bytes sequence.

## Slices

The slice operation can be applied to various data types and has the form:
```
<value> [ <from> : <to> ]
```
The `<from>` and `<to>` terms must be expressions that are coercible
to integers and represent a range of index values to form a subset of elements
from the `<value>` term provided.  The range begins at the `<from>` position
and ends one before the `<to>` position.  A negative
value of `<from>` or `<to>` represents a position relative to the
end of the value being sliced.

If the `<value>` expression is an array, then the result is an array of
elements comprising the indicated range.

If the `<value>` expression is a set, then the result is a set of
elements comprising the indicated range ordered by total order of Zed values.

If the `<value>` expression is a string, then the result is a substring
consisting of unicode code points comprising the given range.

If the `<value>` expression is type `bytes`, then the result is a bytes sequence
consisting of bytes comprising the given range.

## Conditional

A conditional expression has the form
```
<boolean> ? <expr> : <expr>
```
The `<boolean>` expression is evaluated and must have a result of type `bool`.
If not, an error results.

If the result is true, then the first `<expr>` expression is evaluated and becomes
the result.  Otherwise, the second `<expr>` expression is evaluated and
becomes the result.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '{s:"foo",v:1}{s:"bar",v:2}' | zq -z 'yield (s=="foo") ? v : -v' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
1
-2
```

Note that if the expression has side effects,
as with [aggregate function calls](expressions.md#aggregate-function-calls), only the selected expression
will be evaluated.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '"foo" "bar" "foo"' | zq -z 'yield this=="foo" ? {foocount:count()} : {barcount:count()}' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{foocount:1(uint64)}
{barcount:1(uint64)}
{foocount:2(uint64)}
```

## Function Calls

Functions perform stateless transformations of their input value to their return
value and utilize call-by value semantics with positional and unnamed arguments.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield pow(2,3), lower("ABC")+upper("def"), typeof(1)'
```
produces
```mdtest-output
8.
"abcDEF"
<int64>
```

Zed includes many [built-in functions](functions/README.md), some of which take
a variable number of arguments.  

Zed also allows you to create [user-defined functions](statements.md#func-statements).

## Aggregate Function Calls

[Aggregate functions](aggregates/README.md) may be called within an expression.
Unlike the aggregation context provided by a [summarizing group-by](operators/summarize.md), such calls
in expression context yield an output value for each input value.

Note that because aggregate functions carry state which is typically
dependent on the order of input values, their use can prevent the runtime
optimizer from parallelizing a query.

That said, aggregate function calls can be quite useful in a number of contexts.
For example, a unique ID can be assigned to the input quite easily:
```mdtest-command
echo '"foo" "bar" "baz"' | zq -z 'yield {id:count(),value:this}' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{id:1(uint64),value:"foo"}
{id:2(uint64),value:"bar"}
{id:3(uint64),value:"baz"}
```
In contrast, calling aggregate functions within the [`summarize` operator](operators/summarize.md)
```mdtest-command
echo '"foo" "bar" "baz"' | zq -z 'summarize count(),union(this)' -
```
produces just one output value
```mdtest-output
{count:3(uint64),union:|["bar","baz","foo"]|}
```

## Literals

Any of the [data types](data-types.md) may be used in expressions
as long as it is compatible with the semantics of the expression.

String literals are enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes and
must conform to UTF-8 encoding and follow the JavaScript escaping
conventions and unicode escape syntax.  Also, if the sequence `${` appears
in a string the `$` character must be escaped, i.e., `\$`.

### String Interpolation

Strings may include interpolation expressions, which has the form
```
${ <expr> }
```
In this case, the characters starting with `$` and ending at `}` are substituted
with the result of evaluating the expression `<expr>`.  If this result is not
a string, it is implicitly cast to a string.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '{numerator:22.0, denominator:7.0}' | zq -z 'yield "pi is approximately ${numerator / denominator}"' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
"pi is approximately 3.142857142857143"
```

If any template expression results in an error, then the value of the template
literal is the first error encountered in left-to-right order.

> TBD: we could improve an error result here by creating a structured error
> containing the string template text along with a list of values/errors of
> the expressions.

String interpolation may be nested, where `<expr>` contains additional strings
with interpolated expressions.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '{foo:"hello", bar:"world", HELLOWORLD:"hi!"}' | zq -z 'yield "oh ${this[upper("${foo + bar}")]}"' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
"oh hi!"
```

### Record Expressions

Record literals have the form
```
{ <spec>, <spec>, ... }
```
where a `<spec>` has one of three forms:
```
<field> : <expr>
<ref>
...<expr>
```
The first form is a customary colon-separated field and value similar to JavaScript,
where `<field>` may be an identifier or quoted string.
The second form is an [implied field reference](dataflow-model.md#implied-field-references)
`<ref>`, which is shorthand for `<ref>:<ref>`.  The third form is the `...`
spread operator which expects a record value as the result of `<expr>` and
inserts all of the fields from the resulting record.
If a spread expression results in a non-record type (e.g., errors), then that
part of the record is simply elided.

The fields of a record expression are evaluated left to right and when
field names collide the rightmost instance of the name determines that
field's value.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '{x:1,y:2,r:{a:1,b:2}}' | zq -z 'yield {a:0},{x}, {...r}, {a:0,...r,b:3}' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{a:0}
{x:1}
{a:1,b:2}
{a:1,b:3}
```

### Array Expressions

Array literals have the form
```
[ <spec>, <spec>, ... ]
```
where a `<spec>` has one of two forms:
```
<expr>
...<expr>
```

The first form is simply an element in the array, the result of `<expr>`.  The
second form is the `...` spread operator which expects an array or set value as
the result of `<expr>` and inserts all of the values from the result.  If a spread
expression results in neither an array nor set, then the value is elided.

When the expressions result in values of non-uniform type, then the implied
type of the array is an array of type `union` of the types that appear.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield [1,2,3],["hello","world"]'
```
produces
```mdtest-output
[1,2,3]
["hello","world"]
```

Arrays can be concatenated using the spread operator,
```mdtest-command
echo '{a:[1,2],b:[3,4]}' | zq -z 'yield [...a,...b,5]' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
[1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Set Expressions

Set literals have the form
```
|[ <spec>, <spec>, ... ]|
```
where a `<spec>` has one of two forms:
```
<expr>
...<expr>
```

The first form is simply an element in the set, the result of `<expr>`.  The
second form is the `...` spread operator which expects an array or set value as
the result of `<expr>` and inserts all of the values from the result.  If a spread
expression results in neither an array nor set, then the value is elided.

When the expressions result in values of non-uniform type, then the implied
type of the set is a set of type `union` of the types that appear.

Set values are always organized in their "natural order" independent of the order
they appear in the set literal.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield |[3,1,2]|,|["hello","world","hello"]|'
```
produces
```mdtest-output
|[1,2,3]|
|["hello","world"]|
```

Arrays and sets can be concatenated using the spread operator,
```mdtest-command
echo '{a:[1,2],b:|[2,3]|}' | zq -z 'yield |[...a,...b,4]|' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
|[1,2,3,4]|
```

### Map Expressions

Map literals have the form
```
|{ <expr>:<expr>, <expr>:<expr>, ... }|
```
where the first expression of each colon-separated entry is the key value
and the second expression is the value.
When the key and/or value expressions result in values of non-uniform type,
then the implied type of the map has a key type and/or value type that is
a union of the types that appear in each respective category.

For example,
```mdtest-command
zq -z 'yield |{"foo":1,"bar"+"baz":2+3}|'
```
produces
```mdtest-output
|{"foo":1,"barbaz":5}|
```

### Union Values

A union value can be created with a [cast](expressions.md#casts).  For example, a union of types `int64`
and `string` is expressed as `(int64,string)` and any value that has a type
that appears in the union type may be cast to that union type.
Since 1 is an `int64` and "foo" is a `string`, they both can be
values of type `(int64,string)`, e.g.,
```mdtest-command
echo '1 "foo"' | zq -z 'yield cast(this,<(int64,string)>)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
1((int64,string))
"foo"((int64,string))
```
The value underlying a union-tagged value is accessed with the
[`under` function](functions/under.md):
```mdtest-command
echo '1((int64,string))' | zq -z 'yield under(this)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
1
```
Union values are powerful because they provide a mechanism to precisely
describe the type of any nested, semi-structured value composed of elements
of different types.  For example, the type of the value `[1,"foo"]` in JavaScript
is simply a generic JavaScript "object".  But in Zed, the type of this
value is an array of union of string and integer, e.g.,
```mdtest-command
echo '[1,"foo"]' | zq -z 'typeof(this)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
<[(int64,string)]>
```

## Casts

Type conversion is performed with casts and the built-in [`cast` function](functions/cast.md).

Casts for primitive types have a function-style syntax of the form
```
<type> ( <expr> )
```
where `<type>` is a [Zed type](data-types.md#first-class-types) and `<expr>` is any Zed expression.
In the case of primitive types, the type-value angle brackets
may be omitted, e.g., `<string>(1)` is equivalent to `string(1)`.
If the result of `<expr>` cannot be converted
to the indicated type, then the cast's result is an error value.

For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '1 200 "123" "200"' | zq -z 'yield int8(this)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
1(int8)
error({message:"cannot cast to int8",on:200})
123(int8)
error({message:"cannot cast to int8",on:"200"})
```

Casting attempts to be fairly liberal in conversions.  For example, values
of type `time` can be created from a diverse set of date/time input strings
based on the [Go Date Parser library](https://github.com/araddon/dateparse).

```mdtest-command
echo '"May 8, 2009 5:57:51 PM" "oct 7, 1970"' | zq -z 'yield time(this)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
2009-05-08T17:57:51Z
1970-10-07T00:00:00Z
```

Casts of complex or [named types](data-types.md#named-types) may be performed using type values
either in functional form or with `cast`:
```
<type-value> ( <expr> )
cast(<expr>, <type-value>)
```
For example
```mdtest-command
echo '80 8080' | zq -z 'type port = uint16 yield <port>(this)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
80(port=uint16)
8080(port=uint16)
```

Casts may be used with complex types as well.  As long as the target type can
accommodate the value, the case will be recursively applied to the components
of a nested value.  For example,
```mdtest-command
echo '["10.0.0.1","10.0.0.2"]' | zq -z 'cast(this,<[ip]>)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
[10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2]
```
and
```mdtest-command
echo '{ts:"1/1/2022",r:{x:"1",y:"2"}} {ts:"1/2/2022",r:{x:3,y:4}}' | zq -z 'cast(this,<{ts:time,r:{x:float64,y:float64}}>)' -
```
produces
```mdtest-output
{ts:2022-01-01T00:00:00Z,r:{x:1.,y:2.}}
{ts:2022-01-02T00:00:00Z,r:{x:3.,y:4.}}
```
