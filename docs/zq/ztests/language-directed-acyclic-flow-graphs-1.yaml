# ============================================================================
# NOTE: This is a test to protect an example shown in the Zed language
# docs. If you need to make changes to the Zed below to make the tests pass
# again after a change, the docs likely need to be updated as well.
#
# See https://github.com/brimdata/zed/pull/2901 for details
# ============================================================================

# The Zed being tested below has been modified from the way it appears in
# docs/language/README.md:
#
#   from PoolOne | split (
#     => op1 | op2 | ...
#     => op1 | op2 | ...
#   ) | merge ts | ...
#
# Specifically, the "op1", "op2", and "..." have been filled in with real
# operations, and the "merge" has been replaced with a "sort" for now since
# merge has not yet been fully implemented
# (https://github.com/brimdata/zed/issues/2906).
