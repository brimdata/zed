```
{"commit":"0x0ed4fa21616ecd8fec9d6fd395ad876db98a5dae","warnings":null}
```

---

#### Delete Branch

Delete a branch.

```
DELETE /pool/{pool}/branch/{branch}

---

#### Delete Data

Create a commit that reflects the deletion of some data in the branch. The data
to delete can be specified via a list of object IDs or
as a filter expression (see [limitations](../commands/zed.md#delete)).

This simply removes the data from the branch without actually removing the
underlying data objects thereby allowing [time travel](../commands/zed.md#time-travel) to work in the face
of deletes. Permanent removal of underlying data objects is handled by a
separate [vacuum](#vacuum-pool) operation.

```
POST /pool/{pool}/branch/{branch}/delete
```

| Name | Type | In | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -- | ----------- |
| pool | string | path | **Required.** ID of the pool. |
| branch | string | path | **Required.** Name of branch. |
| object_ids | [string] | body | Object IDs to be deleted. |
| where | string | body | Filter expression (see [limitations](../commands/zed.md#delete)). |
| Content-Type | string | header | [MIME type](#mime-types) of the request payload. |
| Accept | string | header | Preferred [MIME type](#mime-types) of the response. |

**Example Request**

```
curl -X POST \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"object_ids": ["274Eb1Kn8MTM6qxPyBpVTvYhLLa", "274EavbXt546VNelRLNXrzWShNh"]}' \

[server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html).
The [MIME type](#mime-types) specified in the request's Accept HTTP header determines the format
of `data` field values in the event stream.

GET /events

```
curl -X GET \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \

```
event: pool-new
data: {"pool_id": "1sMDXpVwqxm36Rc2vfrmgizc3jz"}

event: pool-update
data: {"pool_id": "1sMDXpVwqxm36Rc2vfrmgizc3jz"}

event: pool-commit
data: {"pool_id": "1sMDXpVwqxm36Rc2vfrmgizc3jz", "commit_id": "1tisISpHoWI7MAZdFBiMERXeA2X"}

event: pool-delete
data: {"pool_id": "1sMDXpVwqxm36Rc2vfrmgizc3jz"}
```

## Media Types

For both request and response payloads, the service supports a variety of
formats.

### Request Payloads

When sending request payloads, include the MIME type of the format in the
request's Content-Type header. If the Content-Type header is not specified, the
service will expect ZSON as the payload format.

An exception to this is when [loading data](#load-data) and Content-Type is not
specified. In this case the service will attempt to introspect the data and may
determine the type automatically. The
[input formats](../commands/zq.md#input-formats) table describes which
formats may be successfully auto-detected.

### Response Payloads

To receive successful (2xx) responses in a preferred format, include the MIME
type of the format in the request's Accept HTTP header. If the Accept header is
not specified, the service will return ZSON as the default response format. A
different default response format can be specified by invoking the
`-defaultfmt` option when running [`zed serve`](../commands/zed.md#serve).

For non-2xx responses, the content type of the response will be
`application/json` or `text/plain`.

### MIME Types

The following table shows the supported MIME types and where they can be used.

| Format           | Request   | Response | MIME Type                             |

| JSON             | yes       | yes      | `application/json`                    |
| Line             | yes       | no       | `application/x-line`                  |
| NDJSON           | no        | yes      | `application/x-ndjson`                |
| Parquet          | yes       | yes      | `application/x-parquet`               |
| VNG              | yes       | yes      | `application/x-vng`                   |
| Zeek             | yes       | yes      | `application/x-zeek`                  |
| ZJSON            | yes       | yes      | `application/x-zjson`                 |
| ZSON             | yes       | yes      | `application/x-zson`                  |
| ZNG              | yes       | yes      | `application/x-zng`                   |
