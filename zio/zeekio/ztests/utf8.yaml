# Note the \x syntax is not valid in a ZSON string so there is not a way
# to get \x Zeek TSV escapes into th TSV output unless we add support
# for bytes type to zeekio, in which case we can have support functions
# to parse into and out of \x strings in zeek TSV.  We could also change
# the ZSON spec to explicitly say \x is allowed and is ignored except for
# functions that translate such a string to bytes.
